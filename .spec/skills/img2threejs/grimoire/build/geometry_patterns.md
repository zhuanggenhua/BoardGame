# Procedural Three.js Object Patterns

Use this reference only when implementing a model.

## Geometry Choices

- box: flat machinery, furniture, panels, blockout masses
- sphere/ellipsoid: fruit, knobs, organic joints, rounded stones
- cylinder/cone/capsule: trunks, pipes, limbs, handles, bottles, rockets
- torus: rings, tires, loops, trim, cable coils
- shape extrude: logos, flat ornamental plates, blades, keys, leaves
- lathe: vases, bottles, bowls, lamps, wheels
- tube along curve: cables, roots, branches, straps, hoses
- instanced mesh: screws, rivets, leaves, needles, scales, pebbles, repeated ornaments
- plane cards: thin leaves, feathers, labels, cloth strips, decals

## Material Recipes

- wood: brown base, vertical grain normal, roughness variation, darker creases, lighter worn edges
- stone: mottled albedo, high roughness, bump/normal noise, lichen/dirt patches
- metal: lower roughness, metalness, edge scratches, anisotropic-looking streaks via texture
- plastic: controlled roughness, subtle color variation, bevels to catch highlights
- leaf/plant: alpha cards or thin shape geometry, green hue variation, central vein, translucent-ish bright rim
- water/glass: transparent material only if needed; add environment/reflection cues or it reads as a flat sheet

## Material Layer Fields

For each material, prefer a layered description:

- `baseColor`: dominant sampled color.
- `colorVariation`: palette, mottling pattern, amplitude, regional masks.
- `roughness`: base value, variation amount, map/pattern source.
- `metalness`: base value and local changes.
- `normal`: procedural pattern, strength, scale.
- `bump`: amplitude and scale for small tactile relief.
- `displacement`: only for silhouette-visible or close-up relief.
- `wear`: edge wear, scratches, chips, polish, exposed underlayer.
- `dirt`: amount, cavity bias, color, vertical streaking, contact staining.
- `localOverrides`: named regions where color/roughness/bump differs from the base.

Local overrides should answer: where, what changes, how strong, and which image evidence supports it.

## Local Feature Types

Use `component.localFeatures` for details that matter to recognizability:

- raised ridge
- recessed groove
- seam line
- screw or rivet
- chip or dent
- scratch cluster
- stain or dirt patch
- decal or label area
- hole or socket
- bevel highlight
- fabric stitch
- leaf vein or serrated edge

Each feature should include placement, approximate size, orientation, material effect, geometry effect, and confidence.

## Detail Recipes

Concrete Three.js material/geometry approach per `detailInventory` kind. Cross-reference
`grimoire/intake/detail_inventory.md` for the full taxonomy and the evidence/mapping rule.

- gloss: `MeshPhysicalMaterial` with a low-`roughness` localOverride (0.05-0.2) sized to the
  hotspot region; use `clearcoat`/`clearcoatRoughness` for a lacquer layer over a rougher
  base, `anisotropy`/`anisotropyRotation` for brushed/streaked highlights.
- bevel: real geometry, not a normal map - `edgeTreatment.type = chamfer`, `bevelRadius`
  object-relative (0.02-0.08), `segments` 2-4 for a soft catch-light rim, 1 for a hard edge.
- fastener: `InstancedMesh` for the repeated part; `count` + spacing pattern (linear, radial,
  grid) + head shape (hemisphere/flat/hex) + recess (raised vs countersunk); low-roughness
  metal material on the head crown.
- linework: pick engraved groove (real recessed geometry along a path, catches shadow),
  painted line/decal (canvas-texture localOverride, color contrast only, no relief), or
  panel-line (thin dark AO/roughness localOverride along a seam, no depth) - match whichever
  the reference evidence shows; do not default to decal for something that casts a shadow.
- stain: `material.localOverrides` region with `dirtAmount`, `cavityBias` (concentrate in
  crevices), `streak` (directional, usually gravity-down), `patinaColor` for oxidation hue
  shift, or a `fadedMask` (lighter, desaturated) for sun-bleaching - the inverse of dirt.

## Character Geometry And Material Recipes

Use these when `objectClass.primaryDomain` is `character` or `hybrid`. Pair with
`grimoire/character/reconstruction.md` for proportion/landmark data.

- head: sphere or ellipsoid scaled to the measured head-unit, then displaced/tapered toward
  the reference face shape (jaw width, chin point, cheek fullness) rather than left spherical.
- limbs: capsule or tapered cylinder per segment (upper arm, forearm, thigh, shin); taper
  ratio and length come from `anatomy.proportions`; capsules keep joints visually continuous.
- hands: simplified capsule-cluster (palm block + finger capsules) at low segment count;
  do not attempt per-knuckle detail unless the reference is close-up and complexity is ultra.
- hair: hair cards (alpha-mapped planes layered in clumps) for stylized/low-complexity, or a
  tube-along-curve per lock for wavy/flowing hair with visible strand structure; prefer cards
  by default - hair is the classic single-image failure mode, so favor legible clumps over
  many thin strands that swim or alias.
- face feature placement: position eyes, brows, nose, mouth using `anatomy.faceLandmarks`
  normalized coordinates (eyeLine, eyeSpacing, noseBase, mouthLine, hairline); never eyeball
  placement freehand once landmarks exist.
- eyes: glossy sphere (low roughness, slight clearcoat) plus an iris decal/texture; a correct
  catchlight (small bright localOverride matching the key light) sells more realism than
  extra geometry.
- clothing: extrude or plane panels per garment piece, with fold normals (a normal-map or
  displacement pattern following expected gravity/pose creases) rather than a flat shell;
  reuse Track A detail machinery (seam, stitch, decal, stain) for prints, buttons, wear.
- skin: approximate subsurface scattering, not true SSS - warm base albedo, soft/lower
  roughness variation (skin is not uniformly matte), and a rim or backlight to fake light
  passing through thin tissue (ears, nose edge). Avoid pure-Lambertian flat skin.

## Verification Cues

A procedural object is usually failing when:

- silhouette reads wrong even before material
- every edge is perfectly sharp or perfectly smooth
- material has one flat color and no roughness variation
- lighting hides the form instead of explaining it
- repeated details are too evenly spaced
- close-up details add triangles but not recognizability

## Hard-won patterns — real-object reconstructions (2026-07: BMX bike + M9 bayonet)

**Tube-network > single sweep for framed/tubular subjects.** A bike frame, knife-handle grip, fork, handlebar are *networks of straight members*. Model each member as a component with `attachment.localStart`/`localEnd` (+`baseRadius`) — the generator emits an oriented cylinder (quaternion Y→dir). A single closed `curve-sweep` CatmullRom-smooths into a teardrop blob. (BMX frame was a teardrop until rebuilt as a tube-network.)

**Blockout must contain every silhouette-defining macro part.** A bike blockout with the frame but no wheels does not read as a bike, and coarse silhouette-IoU won't catch the omission. Put wheels/blade/major masses in at `level: macro`.

**Root/container `transform.scale` MUST be `[1,1,1]`.** Children parent to the root node and inherit its transform — a `0.02` "hide" scale shrinks the whole model to a speck. Hide the container with a transparent material (`opacity:0`), never with scale.

**Cloned components inherit `actionProfile.animationRole` — reset it.** Cloning a seeded root carries `animationRole:"root"`, and `root` ∈ ATTACHMENT_ROLES, so every part trips the structural attachment gate. Set a sensible per-part `animationRole` (e.g. `"static-part"`); keep roles like `handle` off non-appendage parts.

**Curve the small details.** Serrations/scallops/teeth as straight boxes look wrong. Use `ellipsoid` (or slightly canted primitives, alternating ±angle) for rounded scallop teeth. Each detail with its own small cant reads as a hand-ground edge.

**Grip / friction texture = geometric ridge segments.** For a knurled/wrapped/segmented grip, model raised barrel bands: a thin core cylinder + N short attachment-tube segments (radius just *proud* of the core, small groove gaps). Size them barely larger than the core — oversized tori read as a coil/spring, not a grip. Material texture alone (no geometry) reads as smooth/"thô".

**`invisibleRoot`/container material is still subject to the material-pass PBR gate.** Give the container a *complete* material (roughness map, frequency bands, textureResolution) — copy a proven one — or it fails "needs usable referencePbr / roughness map" even though it never renders.

## Critical Reconstruction Patterns

These rules prevent common high-fidelity reconstruction failures: open card-like meshes,
constant-thickness blade stock, weak seam overlap, missing grind / distal taper,
texture-only structure, and pass credit assigned to the wrong layer.

**Blades need a real grind, not constant thickness.** A constant-thickness slab reads as a toy cutout even with perfect silhouette. Model a wedge cross-section tapering to a sharp cutting edge using a grind function:
- For each point on the blade surface, compute height ratio from cutting edge (0) to spine (1)
- Apply a grind curve (smoothstep or power function) to taper thickness: full stock at spine, zero at edge
- For clip-point blades, also thin the false edge near the tip
- Implementation example: Z-warp the projected face plates via a `grindWarp` function that applies `halfThk * grind(height)` per vertex

**Do NOT eyeball proportions — extract 1-to-1 from reference.** Eyeballed shapes (guard, pommel, curves) are consistently wrong. Instead:
- Trace each part's exact outline from the reference image (foreground / colour-masked top & bottom per image column)
- Use a fixed image→world mapping function: `X = (nx - 0.5) * SX`, `Y = (CY - ny) * SY` (adjust SX, SY, CY to your reference dimensions)
- Sample exact colours as RGB medians from reference regions, never guess visually
- Store traced points as coordinate arrays (world space) and use them directly in Shape constructors
- For smooth curves, use `splineThru` through traced points rather than manual control point tuning

**Colours: sample, don't guess.** Visual colour estimation is unreliable. For each material:
- Sample RGB median values from reference regions using image analysis tools
- Convert RGB (0-255) to hex: `0xRRGGBB` where each component is in hex
- Record sampled RGB and derived hex values for traceability
- Store these sampled values in comments for traceability and verification

**Parts must physically connect, not just be near each other.** Adjacent components must overlap at their shared seam:
- Check XY overlap between adjacent components (e.g., guard ↔ handle, blade ↔ guard)
- Fix: extend one or both shapes so they overlap by at least 0.02-0.05 world units at the seam
- Verify overlap by checking that `partA.end >= partB.start` for each axis where they meet

**Projection core poke-through prevention.** When using photo-projected face plates over a solid core:
- A solid core behind photo-projected face plates bleeds onto the blade face in the grind-transition band
- Keep the core a thin spine rail (top ~18% of blade height) raised well above the red/black boundary
- Translate the core to sit safely inside the plates: `translate(0, 0, -HALF * 0.525)` for ±0.021 plates
- Ensure the core never reaches the red/black boundary or the grind zone so it never shows on the blade face
