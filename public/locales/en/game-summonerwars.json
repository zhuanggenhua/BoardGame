      "summonerIntro": "This is your Summoner \"Ret-Talus\".\n\nHe has 12 Life, 2 Strength, and is a ranged attacker (range 3).\n\nHe's your most important unit — lose him and you lose the game!",
      "enemySummoner": "This is the enemy Summoner.\n\nDestroy them to win the game!",
      "gateIntro": "This is your Gate.\n\nGates are where you summon new units — you can only place units on empty spaces adjacent to your gates.\n\nProtect your gates, and build new portals to expand your summoning range.",
      "handIntro": "This is your hand.\n\nIt contains unit cards, structure cards, and event cards that you can play during the appropriate phases.\n\nYou draw up to 5 cards at the end of each turn.",
      "cardAnatomy": "Look at this card's attributes:\n\n💎 Cost: Magic required to summon\n❤️ Life: Destroyed when damage equals life\n⚔️ Strength: Number of dice rolled when attacking\n\nHigher strength means more dice when attacking!",
